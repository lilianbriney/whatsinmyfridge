Inventory Management Console Application
This console application serves as a straightforward inventory management system, allowing users to effortlessly add, remove, and view items within their inventory. The application utilizes a JSON file to store inventory data. To get started, clone the repository, navigate to the project directory, and build the project using the .NET Core SDK. Run the application with dotnet run and interact with the inventory through the on-screen menu (A for add, R for remove, V for view, and X for exit). Ensure correct date formatting (mm/dd/yyyy) when adding items, and the application automatically saves inventory data to a data.json file upon exit. Contributions are welcome.

I'm still working on refactoring some code and creating a GUI for a more user-friendly experience
